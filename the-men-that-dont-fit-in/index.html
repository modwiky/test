<p>There&rsquo;s a race of men that don&rsquo;t fit in,<br>
A race that can&rsquo;t stay still;<br>
So they break the hearts of kith and kin,<br>
And they roam the world at will.<br>
They range the field and they rove the flood,<br>
And they climb the mountain&rsquo;s crest;<br>
Theirs is the curse of the gypsy blood,<br>
And they don&rsquo;t know how to rest.</p>
<p>If they just went straight they might go far;<br>
They are strong and brave and true;<br>
But they&rsquo;re always tired of the things that are,<br>
And they want the strange and new.<br>
They say: &ldquo;Could I find my proper groove,<br>
What a deep mark I would make!&rdquo;<br>
So they chop and change, and each fresh move<br>
Is only a fresh mistake.</p>
<p>And each forgets, as he strips and runs<br>
With a brilliant, fitful pace,<br>
It&rsquo;s the steady, quiet, plodding ones<br>
Who win in the lifelong race.<br>
And each forgets that his youth has fled,<br>
Forgets that his prime is past,<br>
Till he stands one day, with a hope that&rsquo;s dead,<br>
In the glare of the truth at last.</p>
<p>He has failed, he has failed; he has missed his chance;<br>
He has just done things by half.<br>
Life&rsquo;s been a jolly good joke on him,<br>
And now is the time to laugh.<br>
Ha, ha! He is one of the Legion Lost;<br>
He was never meant to win;<br>
He&rsquo;s a rolling stone, and it&rsquo;s bred in the bone;<br>
He&rsquo;s a man who won&rsquo;t fit in.</p>
