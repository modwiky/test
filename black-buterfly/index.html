<p>The old world is not gone! it is the only place there is. How could it be gone? this <strong>artificial</strong> world is the one that is by its own nature non-existence. If you live in this artificial world you have not lived at all.</p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>You will grep anything to stay afloat. Even amidst the burning world, you enjoy the flying ashes, thinking they are butterflies</p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>You must change your default setting to always fallback to the old world.
Like its always been.</p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like writing but it is one of the gateway to enter the old world. It is a way which you can clear your system.</p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;urip mung mampir ngombe‚Äù</em> is a statement of truth. understood correctly result in peace. it deserves its place in the top chart of the most-wise-words-ever-spoken. <em>mampir ngombe</em> live is a life worth living, nay, it is the only way to live.</p>

<p>Modern phone is sucks! google is belong to hell! material-you is the ugliest thing in the world. social media sucks! zuckeberg is gone too far. it&rsquo;s only a matter of time untill I, without hesitation, step out of the meta universe, for informations purpose I still have whatsapp. The problem is that nobody seems aware of this and take for granted the use of propietary software within the system, therefore the system sucks! anything that is still within the system is sucks. freedom and independent is merely an empty notion there. You can&rsquo;t unlock your phone like in the old days. Even if you can the apps you&rsquo;ll using will not allow it. The phone company and the app company has something in common; they are company and company make money by any means neccesarry. No one use a phone. The prhase one-use-a-phone is an ilusion the truth is that by using a phone you are used by the system to mantain its continuity. THE MODERN WORLD IS SUCK! Am I born to late? no way! I shall escape, to the old world, the place where I trully belong.</p>
