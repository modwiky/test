Alright this is it. A long night without electricity, like in the good old days..</p>
<p>
What can I do if the fire isn’t there? nothing. Yes, I can do it anyway but it doesn’t seems right. Even if that thing is “a good thing”. Still, no fire, no work.</p>
<p>
The fire is the natural force that move you to do something. And you have no choice but do it. This is the moment when you back in alignment, centered and integrated.</p>
<p>
Life is weird if you have no goal. Me personally, I just say what I see, I just do what needs to be done. Perhaps this is what the ancient called function. If the fire were there that’s the time for me to function.</p>
<p>
There seems to be a problem though, you might have noticed that the fire sometimes is there and sometimes not. But is that really what’s going on? I don’t think so, and here is why..</p>
<p>
Since the fire is not always present we assume that it will arise at certain condition, and if the condition were meet the fire is there. Thus in other words the fire is always there but our condition doesn’t always match the requirement. Our condition is bloated my friend. To function properly we shall debloat ourselves.</p>

<p>I know that it is not the ultimate end of human to persue a bloatfree-existence but it may be safe to say that it is one of those thing that you naturally do after realize where you really are; in the bloated-world.</p>
<p>
The world will forever be bloat. You shall craft your own world my friend. Away from the things of man. This is the moment when your cog start moving and your wheel start turning not because of some external force but by your own pedal, you cut all the dependencies and generate those energy yourself -naturally. The ancient source of power.</p>
<p>
When prince Zuko finally understood what his uncle always told him and drop his biggest bloatware namely hunting the avatar to restore his honor, his fire bending ability was weaken drasticly. The reason is because all of his life the driving force behind his power was fear, anger, and revenge, now he loses that mad ambition and confused because apart from that, he doesn&#39;t know any other way of fire bending. At least untill he visited the sun warior tribe and learn the ancient art of fire bending directly from the source: the Dragon himself.</p>
<p>
For like all thing, as soon as it goes to the world it loses its purity. and bloated shall it be.</p>
