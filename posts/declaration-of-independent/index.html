<p>
When, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for
man to dissolve the beliefs which have connected them with
another, and to assume, among the powers of the earth, the
separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and of
nature’s God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of
mankind requires that they should declare the causes which
impel them to the separation.</p>
<p>
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created
equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain
unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the
pursuit of truth.</p>
<p>
Prudence, indeed, will dictate the long establishment of
freedom and should not be changed for light and transient
pleasure; and, accordingly, all experience has shown, that
mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable,
than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they
are accustomed.</p>
<p>
I, therefore, the representative of my own freedom, solemnly
publish and declare, that this man is to be free and independent
man; that he are absolved from all allegiance to the world, and
that all connection between him and the world is to be totally
dissolved; and that, as free and independent states, he have full
power to levy war and conclude peace and to do all other acts
and things which independent man may do. And for the support
of this declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of
Divine Providence, I pledge my live, my fortunes, and my
sacred honor.</p>
