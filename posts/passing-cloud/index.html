I have to become good at this. This is.. my new hobby. To do nothing but observe the trasitory nature of all things. To see clearly what&#39;s happening but remain untouched by it.</p>
<p>

<p>
The direction that Im heading is a lonely path. For I go the opposite way. Most people, no matter how old they are, are always going somewhere, in a motion of becoming something. As if they knew who they really are. Whereas I, an ignorant fool, thinking that there is no where to go, nothing to chase..</p>
<p>
Thus I reallocate my energy to unbecoming, unraveling the falsehood that clouded my conciousness. You may still see me strolling around this world doing some side-quest. But I&#39;ve always found myself naturaly <a href="https://modwiky.xyz/posts/return">return</a></p>

<p>
It was last night when I thought, &#34;well, I need some sleep&#34; I don&#39;t sleep much lately so this seemed like a natural response. But no, It wasn&#39;t natural at all. Why? because it doesn&#39;t work! Trying to sleep is a bad habit that I must get rid of. It is unnecessary —I always end up lying bed, bombarded by my own mind, eyes wide open. I even blame a coffee for it —sorry poor coffee.</p>
<p>
Sleep is one of those thing that you don&#39;t need to do a thing to do it. Perhaps this is the reason why unintentional sleep feels so good. When the body is tired and needs recovery, it will  —by virtue of its own intelegence— sleep. Sleep does not need you.<br>
<em>Sleep… does not… need you</em>.</p>
