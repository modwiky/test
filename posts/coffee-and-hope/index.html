Duh, it should come at no surprise that the only thing that preventing me from enjoying a cup of coffee is my hope for all the goodness of it –Performance boost and increase focus. Tweaking the metabolism as they say..</p>

What is hope anyway? is it just another bloat?</p>
<p>
<strong>YES</strong></p>
<p>
Hope is just a progam installed on your machine that do nothing but slow you down. We use it as a means to deal with something we don&#39;t understand. In my case, my hope for the goodness of coffee contributed nothing to what really happens. I mean, it is the nature of caffein that makes the magic happen. You see, hope do nothing there –so why hope in the first place?</p>
<p>
Now, how does all this come to play? Well, this is the problem of belief and how human have been so conditioned to operate within this framework. Someone told you long ago to hope for a better tomorrow, and you just believed it because it sounds right or it helps you to go through the hardship of life. You accepted it, whispered it on your prayer, integrated it into your system and it became the basis of your actions. Everybody&#39;s doing it anyway so why not?</p>
<p>
Thus instead of go to the core of the problem –figuring out what the hell is going on, questioning the nature of it– we use the easy way: to simply hope for the magic to happen. But alas, the easy way is never the way. Nor is the hard way the way. The only way is the way of truth.</p>

Hold on, I need to get a coffee..</p>

One day I was working on my bicycle that has flip-flop hub on the rear. On one side it was fixed and the other was freewheel. I wanted to remove the freewheel cog because I don&#39;t use it. The problem was that there wasn&#39;t a tool to do the job so I had to rely on the last resort: hammer and nail. I spent hours hammering the cog and Im sure it was the right direction but still it wouldn&#39;t come off. Damn it!</p>
<p>
After about 2 hours of tinkering and trying, it finally came off. Of course it didn&#39;t just came off, it required some oil applied to the thread and a generous man helping me to hold the entire wheelset steady. and <em>dang dang!</em> only two knocks and that was it.</p>
<p>
Behind all this wasted time and energy was my hope that if I kept trying, kept marching forward, it would eventualy come off, but as the story goes, that wasn&#39;t the case.</p>
<p>
What I want to ilustrate is that how this inner bloatware affects our experience of the world. Imagine if our machine were so clean and bloatfree –how smooth our lives could be?</p>
