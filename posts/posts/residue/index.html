Where? Where is my unflinching scrutiny when I need it? It’s like my ultimate weapon is gone when the time comes. Just as Karna in Kurukshetra.</p>

Confession

<div id="outline-text-headline-1" class="outline-text-2">
<p>God forgive me for wasting this opportunity<br>
And deny the possibility.<br>
Forgive me for being such a fool.<br>
For being full of belief and opinions.<br>
For lived as a mere pleasure seeker.<br>
For I was ignorant and lived within the mind.<br>
Peace and freedom is nowhere to be found</p>
<p>
I have suffered and I have suffered enough<br>
I can laugh and smile but it won’t last<br>
For I have come to know the nature of it.<br>
in silence, in the wild, and in dark only<br>
I know that it is me<br>
A fear based creature.<br>
An un-efficient machine.</p>
<p>
Now I will beg you sir<br>
To bestow your grace upon me<br>
Give me the power to destroy.<br>
Give me the sincerity to see<br>
Let me see, let me destroy.<br>
Let me dance in my own destruction.</p>
<p>
<em>Now I become death</em><br>
<em>The destroyer of world.</em></p>

<p>Peace, peace, peace!<br>
A place where all things reside.<br>
Where the poet gets his inspiration.<br>
Where the warrior pick up his courage.</p>
<p>
Peace, peace, peace!<br>
I witness my burden slowly fell off.<br>
The chain is cracking.<br>
By the grace of the sun I can see.<br>
And when the dark comes,<br>
I know, whom shall I slain.</p>
<p>
<strong>The monkey king is back.</strong></p>
