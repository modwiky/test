<strong>Thankyou.</strong></p>
<p>
When I sit or take a walk and <em>let that sink in</em> so to speak, I always end up with a feeling of gratitude for what has happen. Knowing that <em>all streams flow into the sea, yet the sea is never full</em>.</p>
<p>
In other words, I have come to a point where… yeah, okay. what is, <em><strong>is</strong></em>. Im not trying to imposed my will upon what is. I&#39;ve absolutly destroyed the ilusion of control. Conflict is never my interest after all, if something gets in the way then that&#39;s not the way. Like water. Flows around obstacle.</p>
<p>
The obcstruction of the flow is what I&#39;d like to call bloatware. The reflective response of a bloated creature is to resist the flow, to go <strong>against</strong> the streams not knowing we will arive at the same sea…</p>
