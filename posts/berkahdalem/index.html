The last three months were an absolute roller coaster — from the deepest, uncharted places where life feels so freakin’ real, to a shallow, artificial, fake, insincere drama man plays to fill the void. I’ve seen the truth behind man’s actions: one moved by desire, the other by necessity.

<blockquote>
<p>&#34;I will do what I must&#34;</p>
