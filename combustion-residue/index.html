<p>Where? Where is my unflinching scrutiny when I need it? It&rsquo;s like my ultimate weapon is gone when the time comes. Just as Karna in Kurukshetra.</p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<h1 id="confession">Confession</h1>
<p>God forgive me for wasting this opportunity</p>
<p>And deny the possibility.</p>
<p>Forgive me for being such a fool.</p>
<p>For being full of belief and opinions.</p>
<p>For lived as a mere pleasure seeker.</p>
<p>For I was ignorant and lived within the mind.</p>
<p>Peace and freedom is nowhere to be found</p>
<p>I have suffered and I have suffered enough</p>
<p>I can laugh and smile but it won&rsquo;t last</p>
<p>For I have come to know the nature of it.</p>
<p>in silence, in the wild, and in dark only</p>
<p>I know that it is me</p>
<p>A fear based creature.</p>
<p>An un-efficient machine.</p>
<p>Now I will beg you sir</p>
<p>To bestow your grace upon me</p>
<p>Give me the power to destroy.</p>
<p>Give me the sincerity to see</p>
<p>Let me see, let me destroy.</p>
<p>Let me dance in my own destruction.</p>
<p><em>Now I become death</em>
<em>The destroyer of world.</em></p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<h1 id="rock-solid-foundation">Rock solid foundation</h1>
<p>Peace, peace, peace!</p>
<p>A place where all things reside.</p>
<p>Where the poet gets his inspiration.</p>
<p>Where the warrior pick up his courage.</p>
<p>Peace, peace, peace!</p>
<p>I witness my burden slowly fell off.</p>
<p>The chain is cracking.</p>
<p>By the grace of the sun I can see.</p>
<p>And when the dark comes,</p>
<p>I know, whom shall I slain.</p>
<p>The monkey king is back.</p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<h1 id="tumbleweed">Tumbleweed</h1>
<p>The books left unread.</p>
<p>The practices left undone.</p>
<p>The house is no fire.</p>
<p>His body safe yet his soul turned to ashes.</p>
<p>He can speak but no one will understand him.</p>
<p>For he does not have a common ground.</p>
<p>He live above the world.</p>
<p>Thus he has no friends nor foes.</p>
<p>He has nothing to gain and nothing to lose.</p>
<p>He has no place to go and no desire to stay.</p>
<p>May the wind direct him gently</p>
<p>from his tiny cage to the endless dessert.</p>
<p>Where he actually belongs.</p>
<p>Oh poor tumbleweed..</p>
