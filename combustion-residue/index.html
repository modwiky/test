<p>Where? Where is my unflinching scrutiny when I need it? It&rsquo;s like my ultimate weapon is gone when the time comes. Just as Karna in Kurukshetra.</p>

<h1 id="confession">Confession</h1>
<p>God forgive me for wasting this opportunity
And deny the possibility.
Forgive me for being such a fool.
For being full of belief and opinions.
For lived as a mere pleasure seeker.
For I was ignorant and lived within the mind.
Peace and freedom is nowhere to be found
I have suffer and I have suffer enough
I can laugh and smile but it won&rsquo;t last
For I have come to know the nature of it.
in silence, in the wild, and in dark only
I know that it is me
A fear based creature.
An un-efficient machine.
Now I will beg you sir
To bestow your grace upon me
Give me the power to destroy.
Give me the sincerity to see
Let me see, let me destroy.
Let me dance in my own destruction.
<em>Now I become death</em>
<em>The destroyer of world.</em></p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<h1 id="rock-solid-foundation">Rock solid foundation</h1>
<p>Peace, peace, peace!
A place where all things reside.
Where the poet gets his inspiration.
Where the warrior pick up his courage.</p>
<p>Peace, peace, peace!
I witness my burden slowly fell off.
The chain is cracking.
By the grace of the sun I can see.
And when the dark comes,
I know, whom shall I slain.</p>
<p>The monkey king is back.</p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<h1 id="tumbleweed">Tumbleweed</h1>
<p>The books left unread.
The practices left undone.
The house is no fire.
His body safe yet his soul turned to ashes.
He can speak but no one will understand him.
For he does not have a common ground.
He live above the world.
Thus he has no friends nor foes.
He has nothing to gain and nothing to lose.
He has no place to go and no desire to stay.</p>
<p>May the wind direct him gently
from his tiny cage to the endless dessert.
Where he actually belongs.</p>
<p>O poor tumbleweed..</p>
