Duh, it should comes at no surprise that the only thing that prevent me to enjoy a cup of coffee is my hope for all the goodness of it. Performance boost and increase focus. Tweaking the metabolism as they say..
What is hope anyway? is it just another bloat?</p>
<p>
YES</p>
<p>
Hope is just a progam installed on your machine that do nothing but slow you down. We use it as a mean to deal with something we don&#39;t understand. In my case, my hope for the goodness of coffee contribute nothing to what really happens. I mean, it is the nature of caffein that makes the magic happen. You see, hope do nothing there so why hope in the firstplace?</p>
<p>
Now, how all this come to play? well this is the problem of belief and how human has been so condition to operate within this framework. Someone told you long ago to hope for a better tomorow and you just belief it because it sounds right or it helps you to go through the hardship of life.. you accept it, whisper it on your prayer, integrate it to your system and becomes the basis of your action. Everybody doing it anyway so why not?</p>
<p>
Thus instead of go to the core of the problem, figuring out what the hell is going on, questioning the nature of it, we use the easy way to simply hope for the magic to happen. But alas, the easy way is never the way, nor is the hard way is the way. the only way is the way of truth.</p>

Hold on I need to get a coffee..</p>

One day I was working on my bicycle that has flip-flop hub on the rear. On one side it was fixed and the other is freewheel. I want to remove the freewheel cog because I don&#39;t use it, The problem is that there isn&#39;t a tool to do the job so I had to relied on the last solution: hammer and nail. I spent hours hammering the cog and Im sure it is the right direction but still it doesn&#39;t came off. damn it!</p>
<p>
After about 2 hours of thinkering and trying it finally came off. Offcourse it wasn&#39;t just came off, it required some oil applied to the thread and a generous man helping me to hold the entire whellset in a steady position and dang dang! only two knocks and that&#39;s it.</p>
<p>
Behind all this wasted time and energy is my hope that if I keep trying, keep marching forward, it will eventualy came off, but as the story goes, it wasn&#39;t the case.</p>
<p>
What I want to ilustrate is that how this inner bloatware affect our experience in the world. Imagine if our machine were soo clean and bloatfree, how smooth our live could be?</p>
