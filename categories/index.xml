&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#34;Thy right is to work only, but never to its fruits; let not the fruit-of-action be thy motive, nor let thy attachment be to inaction&amp;#34;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Duh, it should comes at no surprise that the only thing that prevent me to enjoy a cup of coffee is my hope for all the goodness of it. Performance boost and increase focus. Tweaking the metabolism as they say..
What is hope anyway? is it just another bloat?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
YES&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hope is just a progam installed on your machine that do nothing but slow you down. We use it as a mean to deal with something we don&amp;#39;t understand. In my case, my hope for the goodness of coffee contribute nothing to what really happens. I mean, it is the nature of caffein that makes the magic happen. You see, hope do nothing there so why hope in the firstplace?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now, how all this come to play? well this is the problem of belief and how human has been so condition to operate within this framework. Someone told you long ago to hope for a better tomorow and you just belief it because it sounds right or it helps you to go through the hardship of life.. you accept it, whisper it on your prayer, integrate it to your system and becomes the basis of your action. Everybody doing it anyway so why not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thus instead of go to the core of the problem, figuring out what the hell is going on, questioning the nature of it, we use the easy way to simply hope for the magic to happen. But alas, the easy way is never the way, nor is the hard way is the way. the only way is the way of truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hold on I need to get a coffee..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-1&#34;&gt;
Miscellaneous
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-3&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One day I was working on my bicycle that has flip-flop hub on the rear. On one side it was fixed and the other is freewheel. I want to remove the freewheel cog because I don&amp;#39;t use it, The problem is that there isn&amp;#39;t a tool to do the job so I had to relied on the last solution: hammer and nail. I spent hours hammering the cog and Im sure it is the right direction but still it doesn&amp;#39;t came off. damn it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
After about 2 hours of thinkering and trying it finally came off. Offcourse it wasn&amp;#39;t just came off, it required some oil applied to the thread and a generous man helping me to hold the entire whellset in a steady position and dang dang! only two knocks and that&amp;#39;s it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Behind all this wasted time and energy is my hope that if I keep trying, keep marching forward, it will eventualy came off, but as the story goes, it wasn&amp;#39;t the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What I want to ilustrate is that how this inner bloatware affect our experience in the world. Imagine if our machine were soo clean and bloatfree, how smooth our live could be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The last thread that hold me back not to buy the beutiful Galaxy A5 2017 and using it as my daily driver.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You don&amp;#39;t need a new things.&lt;br&gt;
You need a new way to look at things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For there is nothing new under the sun said the preacher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What is old was once a new.&lt;br&gt;
What is new will soon be old.&lt;br&gt;
You can&amp;#39;t trust time my friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The new will virtually appears to be superior to the old, it may seems to cover the deficiency of its predecesor. but only for a moment. For there is already the newest thing ready to unfold. and so on, and so on. ad infinitum?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Can there be a perfection in this material world?&lt;br&gt;
Will there be a time when there are no more new things?&lt;br&gt;
Where would you draw the line?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Years and years I&amp;#39;ve been using this harmful device called smartphone. Yes, Im one of those unfortunate generation that are doomed to have smartphone in a young age. It is harmful in the sense that it makes its user dependent upon it, that&amp;#39;s one thing. The other thing is that it designed for a consoomer and for a consoomer to consume more. It slowly bending the soul of man from a creator to consoomer. A slave to algorithm. Just look at the next person phone, it is very likely that it will have a big screen, and a processor that have alot of number behind its name that is clearly too powerful for basic usage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Society, or rather the system as a whole adapt to this rapid capitalist progress of technology and we are force to use it! This is why galaxy a5 2017 feel &lt;em&gt;perfect&lt;/em&gt; for me, that&amp;#39;s where I draw the line. But on the other side im aware that this is an illusion yet I still fall for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Ciao!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Fire Bending</title>

&lt;p&gt;
Alright this is it. A long night without electricity, like in the good old days..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What can I do if the fire isn’t there? nothing. Yes, I can do it anyway but it doesn’t seems right. Even if that thing is “a good thing”. Still, no fire, no work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The fire is the natural force that move you to do something. And you have no choice but do it. This is the moment when you back in alignment, centered and integrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Life is weird if you have no goal. Me personally, I just say what I see, I just do what needs to be done. Perhaps this is what the ancient called function. If the fire were there that’s the time for me to function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There seems to be a problem though, you might have noticed that the fire sometimes is there and sometimes not. But is that really what’s going on? I don’t think so, and here is why..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Since the fire is not always present we assume that it will arise at certain condition, and if the condition were meet the fire is there. Thus in other words the fire is always there but our condition doesn’t always macth the requirement. Our condition is bloated my friend. To function properly we shall debloat ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-1&#34;&gt;
Bloatfree
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that it is not the ultimate end of human to persue a bloatfree-existence but it may be safe to say that it is one of those thing that you naturally do after realize where you really are; in the bloated-world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The world will forever be bloat. You shall craft your own world my friend. Away from the things of man. This is the moment when your cog start moving and your wheel start turning not because of some external force but by your own pedal, you cut all the dependencies and generate those energy yourself -natturally. The ancient source of power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When prince Zuko finnaly understood what his uncle always told him and drop his biggest bloatware namely hunting the avatar to restore his honor, his fire bending ability was weaken drasticly. The reason is because all of his life the driving force behind his power was fear, anger, and revenge, now he loses that mad ambition and confused because apart from that, he doesn&amp;#39;t know any other way of fire bending. At least untill he visited the sun warior tribe and learn the ancient art of fire bending directly from the source: the Dragon himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For like all thing, as soon as it goes to the wolrd it loses its purity. and bloated shall it be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

		<title>The Old Obsolete</title>

&lt;p&gt;
My current predicament is simply the old habbit, the old pattren that occasionaly arise to the surface of my conciousness while Im off guard. As experience has taugth me that man cannot delete his own memories intentionally. All action that you did is written within your being. Beware my friend, there is no enemies other than yourself. And you are not yourself!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
–&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hey you know what, I think this is the time. I can’t take it anymore okay. Who’s the master huh?, eaten alive by his own thougth!! well it&amp;#39;s not even his own thought, it was a stray thought. A Man like himself would never do anything orginal! what a pity. Rise brother don’t be a slave in your own land. Don’t you remember? that dead is real!! and I saw a lot of dead man lately, their name filled the air for a moment and gone. Just like that. But who am I to judge?.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It is time to be a true samurai. Only between my sword and my demon, only between me and my next duel. True samurai understand the nature of time and how not to waste it! they understand the nature of mind and how to master it. They got no place for dead to enter. Such a beutiful life, a life worth living.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
–&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It is all cringes. Everytime I looked back at my notes I feel like this can’t be me!. Now I feel my shoulder quite weary, it obviously had have enough. I remember a message told by obi-wan to anakin ‘be mindful’ hell if I know what that mean but it kind of fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
–&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
‘The same old evil’. The prhase is kind of okay but I don’t like the world &lt;code class=&#34;verbatim&#34;&gt;evil&lt;/code&gt; and I belive you too. First, what is evil? I don’t know what evil is. For there is no such thing as evil in the real world, in nature, in the wild right? no evil walking around. Yes there is murderer, thieves, and all the gang but is there anything such as evil? you might say that those are evil and I understand, I don’t wanna be rude and call you blind, but you said that because you see it with a different eyes, the eyes that are full of bloatware, layer after layer. these day people are preaching about minimalism as it were a virtue of some sort, nay it simply the truth. To see what really is is to uninstall all those bloatware and see for the first time –the raw truth. Evil is evil because there is no such things as evil and you think that there is and that is the only evil –the same old evil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
–&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The another old obsolete bloatware that I realized is the urge to dramatize an event, to pretend to be a victim of my own doing, and somehow enjoy it. I will talk no more, for that is more of dramatization. Let me go.. further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
–&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
LIfe is a choice? well not exactly, yes you have to draw the line somewhere but remember its only an artificial line. At the end you might notice that that too isn’t fix line. There is some force that push and pull it and it definetely not you. Then, is life a choice? yes and also no!.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
–&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Fear explain everything. From the good to the bad. Thus, it is not about chosing the good and leaving the bad, it is about to be fearless. For fear based action is not action at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
–&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There is simplicity when ‘others’ are removed from the equation. There is peace when there is no expectation. Hopes? Dreams? what is that, nature doesn’t work that way brother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
–&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My old pattern is always to seek answer out there and never have the courage to stand in my own feet. The new pattern however, haven’t fully form yet and that’s fine as a child need assistant wheels before go on riding a real bicycle. &lt;em&gt;“A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-1&#34;&gt;
Miscellaneous
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Totally unrelated. I know all that in here are unrelated, but this is unrelated to the unrelated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
–&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is me cleaning up my internal attic at night because I cannot sleep. Too many proceses runing in the background. There is indeed an old-obsolate-bloatware that trigger the compulsion to force it to stop but I know that can’t be done as the old-man said &lt;em&gt;“Do you have the patience to wait until your mud settles and the water is clear?”&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
–&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Terry was right! they all think the same. Everyone else, their mind are being controled by the CIA, jedi mind trick, and mental roadblock placed by angel!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
–&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Sugar sucks! it is the devil’s pill to stains man soul with the perennial sin of laziness. It ruin my day and destroy my teeth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
–&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Im thinking to convert this document to html and launch a website by the name modwikydotxyz but web server is expensive, so I hold myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Where? Where is my unflinching scrutiny when I need it? It’s like my ultimate weapon is gone when the time comes. Just as Karna in Kurukshetra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-1&#34;&gt;
Conffesion
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God forgive me for wasting this opportunity&lt;br&gt;
And deny the possibility.&lt;br&gt;
Forgive me for being such a fool.&lt;br&gt;
For being full of belief and opinions.&lt;br&gt;
For lived as a mere pleasure seeker.&lt;br&gt;
For I was ignorant and lived within the mind.&lt;br&gt;
Peace and freedom is nowhere to be found&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I have suffered and I have suffered enough&lt;br&gt;
I can laugh and smile but it won’t last&lt;br&gt;
For I have come to know the nature of it.&lt;br&gt;
in silence, in the wild, and in dark only&lt;br&gt;
I know that it is me&lt;br&gt;
A fear based creature.&lt;br&gt;
An un-efficient machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now I will beg you sir&lt;br&gt;
To bestow your grace upon me&lt;br&gt;
Give me the power to destroy.&lt;br&gt;
Give me the sincerity to see&lt;br&gt;
Let me see, let me destroy.&lt;br&gt;
Let me dance in my own destruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Now I become death&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The destroyer of world.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-container-headline-2&#34; class=&#34;outline-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-2&#34;&gt;
Rock Solid Foundation
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-2&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peace, peace, peace!&lt;br&gt;
A place where all things reside.&lt;br&gt;
Where the poet gets his inspiration.&lt;br&gt;
Where the warrior pick up his courage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Peace, peace, peace!&lt;br&gt;
I witness my burden slowly fell off.&lt;br&gt;
The chain is cracking.&lt;br&gt;
By the grace of the sun I can see.&lt;br&gt;
And when the dark comes,&lt;br&gt;
I know, whom shall I slain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The monkey king is back.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
