      <description>By: Robert W. Service there&amp;rsquo;s a race of men that don&amp;rsquo;t fit in,
A race that can&amp;rsquo;t stay still;
So they break the hearts of kith and kin,
And they roam the world at will.
They range the field and they rove the flood,
And they climb the mountain&amp;rsquo;s crest;
Theirs is the curse of the gypsy blood,
And they don&amp;rsquo;t know how to rest.
If they just went straight they might go far;</description>

      <description>I know that it is not the ultimate end of human to persue a bloatfree-existence but it may be safe to say that it is one of those thing that you naturally do after realize where you really are; in the bloated-world.
The world will forever be bloat. You shall craft your own world my friend. Away from the things of man. This is the moment when your cog start moving and your wheel start turning not because of some external force but by your own pedal, you cut all the dependencies and generate those energy yourself -natturally.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;The modern world is very busy, the old world was very.. uh.. you had downtime in the old world. Today you turn on television or whatever and stay busy.”
–Terry Davis
The old world is not gone! it is the only place there is. How could it be gone? this artificial world is the one that is by its own nature non-existence. If you live in this artificial world you have not lived at all.</description>

      <description>My current predicament is simply the old habbit, the old pattren that occasionaly arise to the surface of my conciousness while Im off guard. As experience has taugth me that man cannot delete his own memories intentionally. All action that you did is written within your being. Beware my friend, there is no enemies other than yourself. And you are not yourself!

Hey you know what, I think this is the time.</description>

      <description>Where? Where is my unflinching scrutiny when I need it? It&amp;rsquo;s like my ultimate weapon is gone when the time comes. Just as Karna in Kurukshetra.
&amp;ndash;
Confession God forgive me for wasting this opportunity
And deny the possibility.
Forgive me for being such a fool.
For being full of belief and opinions.
For lived as a mere pleasure seeker.
For I was ignorant and lived within the mind.
Peace and freedom is nowhere to be found</description>
