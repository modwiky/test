      <description>Alright this is it. A long night without electricity, like in the good old days.
What can I do if the fire isn&amp;rsquo;t there? nothing. Yes, I can do it anyway but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t seems right. Even if that thing is &amp;ldquo;a good thing&amp;rdquo;. Still, no fire, no work.
The fire is the natural force that moved you to do something. And you have no choice but do it and do it you will.</description>

      <description>By: Robert W. Service There&amp;rsquo;s a race of men that don&amp;rsquo;t fit in,
A race that can&amp;rsquo;t stay still;
So they break the hearts of kith and kin,
And they roam the world at will.
They range the field and they rove the flood,
And they climb the mountain&amp;rsquo;s crest;
Theirs is the curse of the gypsy blood,
And they don&amp;rsquo;t know how to rest.
If they just went straight they might go far;</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;The modern world is very busy, the old world was very.. uh.. you had downtime in the old world. Today you turn on television or whatever and stay busy.”
–Terry Davis
The old world is not gone! it is the only place there is. How could it be gone? this artificial world is the one that is by its own nature non-existence. If you live in this artificial world you have not lived at all.</description>

      <description>My current predicament is simply the old habbit, the old pattren that occasionaly arise to the surface of my conciousness while Im off guard. As experience has taugth me that man cannot delete his own memories intentionally. All action that you did is written within your being. Beware my friend, there is no enemies other than yourself. And you are not yourself!

      <description>Where? Where is my unflinching scrutiny when I need it? It&amp;rsquo;s like my ultimate weapon is gone when the time comes. Just as Karna in Kurukshetra.
&amp;ndash;
Confession God forgive me for wasting this opportunity
And deny the possibility.
Forgive me for being such a fool.
For being full of belief and opinions.
For lived as a mere pleasure seeker.
For I was ignorant and lived within the mind.
Peace and freedom is nowhere to be found</description>
