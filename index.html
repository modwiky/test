<h1 id="the-old-obsolete">The old obsolete</h1>
<p>My current predicament is simply the old habbit, the old pattren that
occasionaly arise to the surface of my conciousness while Im off guard.
As experience has taugth me that man cannot delete his own memories
intentionally. All action that you did is written within your being.
Beware my friend, there is no enemies other than yourself. And you are
not yourself!</p>

<p>Hey you know what, I think this is the time. I can’t take it anymore
okay. Who’s the master huh?, eaten alive by his own thougth!! well its
not even his own thought, it was a stray thought. A Man like himself
would never do anything orginal! what a pity. Rise brother don’t be a
slave in your own land. Don’t you remember? that dead is real!! and I
saw a lot of dead man lately, their name filled the air for a moment and
gone. Just like that. But who am I to judge?.</p>
<p>It is time to be a true samurai. Only between my sword and my demon,
only between me and my next duel. True samurai understand the nature of
time and how not to wasted it! they understand the nature of mind and
how to mastered it. They got no place for dead to enter. Such a beutiful
life, a life worth living.</p>
<p>–</p>
<p>It is all cringes. Everytime I looked back at my notes I feel like
this can’t be me!. Now I feel my shoulder quite weary, it obviously had
have enough. I remember a message told by obi-wan to anankin ‘be
mindful’ hell if I know what that mean but it kind of fit.</p>
<p>–</p>
<p>‘The same old evil’. The prhase is kind of okay but I don’t like the
world ’evil and I belive you too. First, what is evil? I don’t know what
evil is. For there is no such thing as evil in the real world, in
nature, in the wild right? no evil walking around. Yes there is
murderer, theif, and all the gang but is there anything such as evil?
you might say that those are evil and I understand, I don’t wanna be
rude and call you blind, but you said that because you see it with a
different eyes, the eyes that are full of bloatware, layer after layer.
these day people are preaching about minimalism as it were a virtue of
some sort, nay it simply the truth. To see what really is is to
uninstall <strong>all</strong> those bloatware and see for the first
time –the raw truth. Evil is evil because there is no such things as
evil and you think that there is and that is the only evil –the same old
evil.</p>
<p>–</p>
<p>The another old obsolete bloatware that I realized is the urge to
dramatize an event, to pretend to be a victim of my own doing, and
somehow enjoy it. I will talk no more, for that is more of
dramatization. Let me go.. <strong>further</strong>.</p>

<p>LIfe is a choice? well not exactly, yes you have to draw the line
somewere but remember its only an artificial line. At the end you might
notice that that too isn’t fix line. There is some force that push and
pull it and it definetely not you. Then, is life a choice? yes and also
no!.</p>
<p>–</p>
<p>Fear explain everything. From the good to the bad. Thus, it is not
about chosing the good and leaving the bad, it is about to be fearless.
For fear based action is not action at all.</p>
<p>–</p>
<p>There is simplicity when ‘others’ are removed from the equation.
There is peace when there is no expectation. Hopes? Dreams? what is
that, nature doesn’t work that way brother.</p>
<p>–</p>
<p>My old pattern is always to seek answer out there and never have the
courage to stand in my own feet. The new pattern however, haven’t fully
form yet and that’s fine as the child need assistant wheels before go on
riding a real bicycle. <em>“A journey of a thousand miles begins with a
single step”</em></p>

<p>Totally unrelated. I know all that in here are unrelated, but this is
unrelated to the unrelated.</p>

<p>This is me cleaning up my internal attic at night because I cannot
sleep. Too many proceses runing in the background. There is indeed an
old-obsolate-bloatware that trigger the compulsion to force it to stop
but I know that can’t be done as the old-man said <em>“Do you have the
patience to wait until your mud settles and the water is
clear?”</em>.</p>

<p>Terry was right! they all think they same. Everyone else, their mind
are being controled by the CIA, jedi mind trick, and mental roadblock
placed by angel!</p>

<p>Sugar sucks! it is the devil’s pill to stains man soul with the
perennial sin of laziness. It ruins my day and destroys my teeth.</p>

<p>Im thinking to convert this document to html and launch a website by
the name modwikydotxyz but web server is expensive, so I hold
myself.</p>
