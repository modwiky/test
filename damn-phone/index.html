You don&#39;t need a new things.<br>
You need a new way to look at things.</p>
<p>
For there is nothing new under the sun said the preacher.</p>
<p>
What is old was once a new.<br>
What is new will soon be old.<br>
You can&#39;t trust time my friend.</p>
<p>
The new will virtually appears to be superior to the old, it may seems to cover the deficiency of its predecesor. but only for a moment. For there is already the newest thing ready to unfold. and so on, and so on. ad infinitum?</p>
<p>
Can there be a perfection in this material world?<br>
Will there be a time when there are no more new things?<br>
Where would you draw the line?</p>

Years and years I&#39;ve been using this harmful device called smartphone. Yes, Im one of those unfortunate generation that are doomed to have smartphone in a young age. It is harmful in the sense that it makes its user dependent upon it, that&#39;s one thing. The other thing is that it designed for a consoomer and for a consoomer to consume more. It slowly bending the soul of man from a creator to consoomer. A slave to algorithm. Just look at the next person phone, it is very likely that it will have a big screen, and a processor that have alot of number behind its name that is clearly too powerful for basic usage.</p>
<p>
Society, or rather the system as a whole adapt to this rapid capitalist progress of technology and we are force to use it! This is why galaxy a5 2017 feel <em>perfect</em> for me, that&#39;s where I draw the line. But on the other side im aware that this is an illusion yet I still fall for it.</p>
